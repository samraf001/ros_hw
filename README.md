# Robotic_HW
## Context
The design of our cells in Machina Labs has evolved over the past years. Currently, each of our cells has two articulated industrial robots on rails (a total of 7 axes) and a frame with hydraulic clamps. For the parts to form correctly, we must exert and maintain a dynamic force during the forming in a very accurate location in space. Currently, each robot is equipped with a load cell. See a quick video about our process [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqYMprTEXRI). We are using ROS2 to collect the data from the network and control the robots in real-time. As a robotic engineer, we keep developing different modules for our network to add features to the system.  
 
## Objective
The goal of This project is to build a ROS2 network that collects data from 3-DOF sensors and makes the filtered data available as a ROS service and topic. Since we cannot send a real sensor to all of our applicants, we made a simple simulator (sensor.py) that mimics the behavior of a real sensor but with random data. 
- The first task is to make a custom service for 3-DOF sensor 
- The second task is to make a ROS2 service server that continuously reads data from the sensor and has the latest filter data available for the client service that you make. 
- Finally, please make a simple client that calls two of these services and publishes them to a topic at 500Hz. Please keep in mind that your service servers can run slower than 500Hz. 
- You can define a second server in the simulator to modify the code and run two at the same time.
- You can check the example.py to see how to make calls to the sensor

## Grading Criteria
- Weâ€™re looking for code that is clean, readable, performant, and maintainable.
- The developer must think through the process of deploying and using the solution and provide the necessary documentation. 
- The sensor samples with 2000Hz, and you can request a specific number of samples in each call. Each call also has a ~1ms delay on top of the sampling time. We would like to hear your thought on picking the number of samples that you read in each call.

**Solution**

**ROS 2 3-DOF Sensor Data Pipeline**

Overview
This ROS 2 project facilitates the acquisition, processing, and publication of 3-DOF sensor data. It consists of two primary packages:

ros_hw_interfaces: Defines the custom service interface ThreeDOF.srv.

ros_hw: Implements the service server (service_server.py) and the data client (data_client.py).

The system is designed to request raw and cleaned sensor data via TCP, process it, and publish the results on ROS 2 topics.

**Features**
Service Server: Connects to a TCP sensor, retrieves data, processes it, and serves it via ROS 2 services.

Data Client: Periodically requests data from the service server and publishes it to ROS 2 topics.

Custom Service Interface: ThreeDOF.srv defines the request and response structure for data acquisition.

**Prerequisites**

Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04

ROS 2 Distribution: Humble Hawksbill

Python: 3.10 or higher

Packages:

rclpy

std_msgs

numpy

Ensure that the ROS 2 environment is properly sourced:

bash
Copy
Edit
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
Installation

**1. Create a ROS 2 Workspace:**

mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws/src

**Clone the Repositories:**

git clone <repository_url_for_ros_hw_interfaces>
git clone <repository_url_for_ros_hw>

**2. Build the Workspace:**

cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build

**3. Source the Workspace:**

source install/setup.bash

**Usage**


Running the Service Server

Start the service server to connect to the TCP sensor and provide data services:

`ros2 run ros_hw service_server`

Running the Data Client

The data client requests data from the service server and publishes it to ROS 2 topics. You can specify the publishing frequency using the --ros-args parameter:


`ros2 run ros_hw data_client --ros-args -p publish_frequency:=10.0`

Replace 10.0 with your desired frequency in Hz.

**Monitoring Published Topics**

To monitor the published data:

`ros2 topic echo /raw_data`

`ros2 topic echo /cleaned_data`

**Adjusting Parameters at Runtime**

You can adjust the publishing frequency at runtime using:

`ros2 param set /data_client publish_frequency 20.0`

**Custom Service Interface: ThreeDOF.srv**

Located in ros_hw_interfaces/srv/ThreeDOF.srv, this service interface is defined as:

int32 num_samples
---
float32[] x
float32[] y
float32[] z

Request: Number of samples to retrieve.

Response: Arrays of x, y, and z axis data.

**System Architecture**

The system comprises:

Service Server (service_server.py):

Connects to the TCP sensor.

Retrieves and processes raw data.

Provides two services:

get_raw_3dof_data

get_cleaned_3dof_data

Data Client (data_client.py):

Periodically requests data from the service server.

Publishes raw and cleaned data to:

/raw_data

/cleaned_data

**Performance Considerations**

Sampling Rate: The sensor samples at 2000 Hz.

Service Call Delay: Each service call introduces approximately 1 ms delay.

Optimal Sample Size: To balance performance and data freshness, requesting around 10 samples per call is recommended.
